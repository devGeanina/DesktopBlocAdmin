## BlocAdmin for Desktop
Desktop application that allows the administrator of any building complex to manage the information regarding the buildings, residents, resident requests, budgets and expenses, as well as keeping all the information and documents in one place.

## Getting Started
Import the project into Netbeans or a platform of your choosing supporting JavaFX. Install a local Postgresql database to store the information. Set up the database information once you run the application from Database Settings. This allows the user to set up its own database, catered to the size and security that he needs.

The application contains information about the users (owner, employees, associates, admin, other), the households that are located in the managed building complex, budgets and sources, expenses for either the residents, taxes, employees salaries and other categories and allows to register requests coming from the residents or external parties, be it complaints, document releases or others.

## Settings configuration
The application allows the user to change the database settings to contain a specific database URL, username and password.

## Built With
* Postgresql - database to store the application information, configurable inside the application as per client's needs.
